== Description ==

Single Opt-In AJAX Mailchimp Newsletter form for Wordpress. You can switch between single opt-in and double opt-in. Use it as Widget or Shortcode and style it however you want. It uses the Bootstrap3 classes, therfore it will perfectly fit in a Bootstap3 Theme for Wordpress.

You only need your API Key and the List ID. Within the settings Tab you can choose what kind of Opt-In you want to use. Also you can define the error/success message but also the placeholder and labels.

A short guidance within the settings is also provided.
